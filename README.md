# Hi there, I'm Dante Diza! 👋
   
I am an information systems & technology professional, a life-long learner of all things data, machine learning, application development, and cloud technologies.

My undergraduate degree is in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in software engineering management. I completed the **Post-Graduate Program in Data Science & Business Analytics with the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business** (**[PGP-DS&BA](https://onlineexeced.mccombs.utexas.edu/online-data-science-business-analytics-course)**) as well as a **full stack software development program with Austin Coding Academy** (**[MongoDB-Express-React-Node](https://austincodingacademy.com/courses/software-development-online/)**).

Thank you for stopping by.
