# Hi there, I'm Dante Diza! 👋
   
I am an Information Systems & Technology professional and lifelong learner of all things data, machine learning, application development, and cloud technologies.

My undergraduate degree is in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in software engineering management. I also completed a **Post-Graduate Program in Data Science & Business Analytics with the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business** (**[PGP-DS&BA](https://vrfy.digital/index.php?key=SZcBb)**) as well as a **full-stack software development program with Austin Coding Academy** (**[MongoDB-Express-React-Node](https://austincodingacademy.com/courses/software-development-online/)**).

Thank you for stopping by.
